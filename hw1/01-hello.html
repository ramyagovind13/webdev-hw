      <p>
        My name is Ramya. I am a graduate student and this is my first term in
        PSU. I worked as backend software developer in one of the multinational
        companies. I have knowledge about backend technologies about how it
        works. I am excited to learn front end as part of this course. Apart
        from this, in my free time I would like to do sketching, portrait and
        cooking.
